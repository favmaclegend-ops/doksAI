Description

Implement comprehensive conversation history management with sidebar navigation and enhanced message actions.
User Stories

    As a user, I want to see all my past conversations in a sidebar so I can quickly navigate between them
    As a user, I want to search through my conversation history to find specific discussions
    As a user, I want to copy, regenerate, or edit messages for better interaction

Tasks
Conversation Sidebar Component

Create src/components/ConversationSidebar.vue component

        Display all sessions from getAllSessions()
        Implement search functionality
        Add delete/archive actions
        Show conversation previews (first message)
        Add collapsible sidebar functionality
        Implement keyboard shortcuts for navigation

Store Updates

Update src/store/types.ts

    Add title?: string to ChatSession interface
    Add updatedAt: Date to ChatSession interface

Update src/store/index.ts 

        Implement auto-title generation for sessions
        Add session update timestamp tracking
        Add session archiving functionality

Message Actions

Enhance src/pages/ChatView.vue

        Add copy message button with clipboard API
        Add regenerate response button
        Add edit user message functionality
        Add message action toolbar/menu

Acceptance Criteria

Sidebar displays all conversations with auto-generated titles and timestamps
Search filters conversations by content (searches through all messages)
Can delete/archive conversations with confirmation dialog
Message actions (copy, regenerate, edit) work correctly
Session titles auto-generate based on first user query
UI is responsive and matches existing design system
Sidebar is collapsible and remembers state
No performance issues with large conversation histories (100+ sessions)

Dependencies

    Current v0.1.0 features
    useChatStore from src/store/index.ts
    ChatSession type from src/store/types.ts
    Existing ChatView.vue component

Design Notes

    Sidebar should be collapsible (default width: 280px)
    Use consistent styling with existing UI theme
    Consider adding keyboard shortcuts:
        Ctrl+K or Cmd+K for quick search
        Ctrl+N or Cmd+N for new conversation
    Session preview should show first 50 characters
    Timestamps should use relative time format ("2 hours ago", "Yesterday")

Technical Considerations

    Use virtual scrolling for large conversation lists
    Debounce search input (300ms)
    Implement lazy loading for conversation previews
    Store sidebar state in localStorage
    Use Vue transitions for smooth UI animations

Testing Checklist
